Starting template for data projects

This is my template for the Data Wrangling Final Project.

## Intro

The relationship between a movie's critical reception and its box office performance has long intrigued filmmakers and analysts alike. This project explores this connection by analyzing the IMDb ratings, Metascores, and worldwide lifetime gross revenue of top-grossing movies. Using data from IMDb's Top 100 Movies and a dataset of the Top 1,000 Highest-Grossing Movies, this analysis aims to uncover key insights into how audience ratings and critical acclaim relate to financial success. Specifically, the study addresses three primary research questions: the correlation between IMDb ratings and box office revenue, the relationship between IMDb ratings and Metascores, and whether higher IMDb ratings translate to higher lifetime gross revenue. Through data cleaning, filtering, and exploratory visualizations, this report provides a comprehensive overview of trends and relationships in movie success metrics. 






## Brief Outline
In this template I have uploaded everything in relation to the project. This includes both of the raw data files, my final cleaned and merged dataset, both notebooks I worked in for the project, images of all the graphs/charts related, and the report itself.
